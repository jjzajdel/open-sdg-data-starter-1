  ## Definition:
    The national poverty rate is the percentage of the total population living below the national poverty line.
    The rural poverty rate is the percentage of the rural population living below the national poverty line (or
    in cases where a separate, rural poverty line is used, the rural poverty line). Urban poverty rate is the
    percentage of the urban population living below the national poverty line (or in cases where a separate,
    urban poverty line is used, the urban poverty line)
  ## Concepts:
  **Poverty Line:** Threshold below which individuals
  in the reference population are considered poor and above which they are
  considered non-poor. The threshold is generally defined as the per-capita
  monetary requirements an individual needs to afford the purchase of a basic
  bundle of goods and services.
